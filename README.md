# Pilot Structure

Per our chat on 12/21 we need 32 lessons grouped into 8 weeks/units. A lesson
would be 60 mins of lecture that fades in 30 mins of lab time with structured
scenarios to reinforce learning.  Weâ€™d also have a 30 mins or so Snack and Talk
session between the lessons that we can use to bring in folks to talk, or
address socializing/networking issues, etc. 

* Week 1: Compute node overview using local host, vagrant, and mobile devices
* Week 2: Compute environments using Amazon Web Services
* Week 3: Storing data using databases and file services
* Week 4: Setting up an application
* Week 5: Deploying applications
* Week 6: Scaling storage with EBS, LVM, S3
* Week 7: Scaling compute with ELB, haproxy
