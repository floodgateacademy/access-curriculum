# FGAccess Structure

Per our chat on 12/21 we need 32 lessons grouped into 8 weeks/units. A lesson
would be 60 mins of lecture that fades in 30 mins of lab time with structured
scenarios to reinforce learning.  Weâ€™d also have a 30 mins or so Snack and Talk
session between the lessons that we can use to bring in folks to talk, or
address socializing/networking issues, etc. 

### Lesson 1 of the day

    [ 60m lecture                           ]  
    [ 30m lab          ] [ 30m snack & talk ]

### Lesson 2

    [ 60m lecture                           ]  
    [ 30m lab          ] [ 30m snack & talk ]

# Example Curriculum

A typical devops project is setting up and deploying applications onto
workstation, development, and production environments, while scaling
storage/compute with automation as much as possible. 

In this example curriculum, we use a web server to show the outline of
that typical devops project.

* [Unit 1](unit-1.md): Compute server overview using local host, vagrant, and mobile devices
* [Unit 2](unit-2.md): Compute environments using Amazon Web Services
* [Unit 3](unit-3.md): Storing data using databases and file services
* [Unit 4](unit-4.md): Setting up an application
* [Unit 5](unit-5.md): Deploying applications
* [Unit 6](unit-6.md): Scaling storage with EBS, LVM, S3
* [Unit 7](unit-7.md): Scaling compute with ELB, haproxy
* [Unit 8](unit-8.md): Automate as much as possible
