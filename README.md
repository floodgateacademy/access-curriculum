# Pilot Structure

Per our chat on 12/21 we need 32 lessons grouped into 8 weeks/units. A lesson
would be 60 mins of lecture that fades in 30 mins of lab time with structured
scenarios to reinforce learning.  We’d also have a 30 mins or so Snack and Talk
session between the lessons that we can use to bring in folks to talk, or
address socializing/networking issues, etc. 

### Lesson 1 of the day

    [ 60m lecture                           ]  
    [ 30m lab          ] [ 30m snack & talk ]

### Lesson 2
