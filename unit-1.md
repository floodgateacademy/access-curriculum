# Unit 1: Compute server overview

Students explore what makes a server and how servers interact in a local
network.  This unit establishes the concepts such as services, file,
process, server, addressing that will be reinforced in later units.

The concrete project is setting up a web server for pictures and web
pages.  By the end of the unit, students will set up web servers for
each other as well as themselves, and manage web content using images
and folders.

Day 1 touches on setting up a local web server, leading to Day 2 of
networking servers together.

### Day 1.1:

Establish basic concepts of what is a server, and how they are already
using advanced computers on their phones, tablets, and media centers.

  * Explore OS X on their workstations
  * Explore iOS/Android on their phones, tablets, media centers

#### Planned Activities

#### Materials Needed



### Day 1.2:

Extend basic server concepts from OS X/iOS/Android to Ubuntu using a
local virtual machine.  Able to serve images using local storage.

  * Explore Ubuntu in VirtualBox vagrants with a web server

#### Planned Activities

#### Materials Needed

### Day 2.3:

Extend local web server to networked servers.  Students can visit not
only their local web servers, they visit each other's web servers.

  * Explore networking with OS X workstations and Ubuntu web servers

#### Planned Activities

#### Materials Needed

### Day 2.4:

Do remote work on partner workstations.  Show there's not much
difference between remote work in a vagrant and in a remote workstation.

  * Set up more Ubuntu web servers on partner's workstations

#### Planned Activities

#### Materials Needed
