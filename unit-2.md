# Unit 2: Extend local compute to the cloud

Students take their local environment into the cloud with Amazon Web
Services.  The concrete project is setting up a publically accessible
shared environment, with each team member responsible for a component of
the environment.

Day 1 touches on setting up their aws accounts and credentials,
leveraging their local work on the cloud.  Day 2 continues by examining
additional features and constraints of the cloud by examining the
public, cost, and utility aspects of the cloud.

### Day 1.1: 

Establish basic concepts of a cloud environment and how it is different
from a local environment.  

  * Setup aws account and credentials.
  * Explore aws account which is shared with the class.

### Day 1.2: 

Use the same code in the local environment to provision servers in the
cloud environment.

  * Explore Ubuntu in aws vagrants with a web server
  * Access web server publically

### Day 2.3: 

Demonstrate the versatility of the cloud by setting up a second set of
web servers.  Restrict web server access to the lab network.
  
  * Security groups

### Day 2.4: 

Demonstrate versatility by reloading second set of web servers
temporarily with different instance types and re-running benchmarks.
Show how tradeoffs are made between cost and features.

  * Re-provision web servers
  * Run benchmarks
